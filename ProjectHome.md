Are you developing an Android application where the user reads a static map, a comics page, a cheatsheet, or any other kind of big image? Such an image does not fit on most devices' screen, and that's where AndroidBigImage comes in: integrate a few Java files into your application to let your users zoom and scroll in big images.
